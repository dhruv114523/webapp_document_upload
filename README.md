# Web App for Document Upload

### Description

This is an early-stage web platform that allows users to upload documents (PDFs, text, etc.), store them in a MongoDB database with automatically extracted metadata, and interact with them through a smart search interface.  
A key feature is the automatically generated dashboard that visualizes document trends, user behavior, and metadata analytics, built to support exploratory data analysis and decision-making.

> 📝 Note:  
> The MongoDB integration and core backend logic were fully implemented and tested in the original MVP.

> The original implementation remains preserved in this repository for transparency and reference.
