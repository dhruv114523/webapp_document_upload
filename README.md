# Web app for Document Upload

### Description
---
This is an early-stage web platform that allows users to upload documents (PDFs, text, etc.), store them in a MongoDB database with automatically extracted metadata, and interact with them through a smart search interface.
A key feature is the automatically generated dashboard that visualizes document trends, user behavior, and metadata analytics â€” built to support exploratory data analysis and decision-making.
