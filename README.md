# Web App for Document Upload

### Description

This is an early-stage web platform that allows users to upload documents (PDFs, text, etc.), store them in a MongoDB database with automatically extracted metadata, and interact with them through a smart search interface.  
A key feature is the automatically generated dashboard that visualizes document trends, user behavior, and metadata analytics, built to support exploratory data analysis and decision-making.

## Backend Overview

This MVP includes:
- Fully functional MongoDB integration
- File upload, storage, and search capability
- Automatic dashboard creation using metadata of documents that are uploaded

> 📝 Note:  
> The original, fully tested backend implementation is preserved and will be reintroduced here shortly. The decision to reimplement the backend from scratch is under review.
